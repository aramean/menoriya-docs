# Anti-Discrimination Policy

We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment for all users. We do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other characteristic protected by law.

All users, whether guests or hosts, are expected to treat each other with respect and dignity. Any behavior that violates this policy will not be tolerated, and offending users may face penalties including removal from the platform.

We encourage everyone to engage in a positive and supportive manner. Our goal is to ensure that our platform remains a welcoming place for all.

If you experience or witness any form of discrimination, please report it immediately to our support team for appropriate action.
